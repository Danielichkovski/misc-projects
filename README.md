# Miscellaneous HDL Projects

This repository contains a collection of small-to-medium HDL projects, each with its own purpose, simulation environment, and README.  
The projects are primarily implemented in **SystemVerilog** and are meant for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of digital design concepts.

## Projects Included

### 1. AXI-Lite Master/Slave
A simple AXI4-Lite master and slave example demonstrating register access, handshaking, and memory operations.  
See `Axi_lite/README.md` for details and instructions.

### 2. UVM 8-bit Adder Testbench
A basic 8-bit adder DUT verified with a full **UVM 1.2 testbench**.  
Includes randomized sequences, a driver, monitor, and scoreboard.  
See `UVM_Adder/README.md` for details and simulation instructions.

## Usage
Each project is self-contained.  
Please refer to the README inside each project folder for setup, simulation instructions, and details.
